## Scenario



Michael is a 20-year-old university student who walks across campus between classes every day. He wants to get from his classes to the library quickly and usually pays little attention to his surroundings during these walks.

As part of his daily routine, Michael typically walks quickly between buildings, thinking about his assignments or checking his phone. The campus pathways are just a means to get from one location to another, and he rarely notices the environment or other students around him.

While walking his usual route, Michael encounters a problem that isn't addressed in the typical campus experience - the pathways feel impersonal and don't encourage awareness of one's presence in a shared public space. Students like Michael tend to move through these spaces without any acknowledgment or sense of their place within the campus community.

As Michael walks beneath a tall pole along the pathway, a spotlight suddenly shines on him and begins to follow him. The light stays centered on him as he walks, moving smoothly to track his movements. This tracking spotlight provides a solution to the impersonal nature of campus pathways by creating a moment of awareness and connection. The spotlight follows him perfectly, making his presence in the public space visible and acknowledged.

Michael finds the experience transforms his usual walk. He becomes aware of himself in the space, notices other students watching him, and becomes conscious of his movements. After trying different ways of moving to see how the spotlight responds, he continues on his way. When he moves out of range, the spotlight transitions to follow another student entering the area. The next day, Michael purposely takes the same route again, curious to experience the interactive installation once more.

While the spotlight installation creates a novel interactive experience, it also raises important privacy considerations. Some students might feel uncomfortable being suddenly illuminated in a public space without prior consent. Even the feeling of being tracked or observed by an automated system can trigger anxiety or discomfort in certain individuals, especially those who value personal privacy in public spaces or have had negative experiences with surveillance.

To address these legitimate privacy concerns, the SpotlightTrack installation includes several thoughtfully designed elements:

1. **Clear Notification Signage**: Signs are prominently displayed at all entrances to the installation area, informing visitors that they are entering an interactive art space where motion tracking technology is in use.

2. **Opt-out Pathway**: An alternative pathway is available for those who prefer not to participate in the interactive experience, clearly marked to allow people to bypass the installation area.

3. **Limited Data Collection**: The system is designed to track movement only, without capturing or storing any personally identifiable information or images. No facial recognition is employed.

4. **Transparent Technology**: An information panel near the installation explains how the technology works, what data is (and isn't) being collected, and the artistic purpose behind the installation.

5. **Time-Limited Operation**: The installation operates only during specific hours, which are clearly communicated to the campus community, allowing people to plan their routes accordingly.
