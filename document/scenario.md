## Scenario



Michael is a 20-year-old university student who walks across campus between classes every day. He wants to get from his classes to the library quickly and usually pays little attention to his surroundings during these walks.

As part of his daily routine, Michael typically walks quickly between buildings, thinking about his assignments or checking his phone. The campus pathways are just a means to get from one location to another, and he rarely notices the environment or other students around him.

While walking his usual route, Michael encounters a problem that isn't addressed in the typical campus experience - the pathways feel impersonal and don't encourage awareness of one's presence in a shared public space. Students like Michael tend to move through these spaces without any acknowledgment or sense of their place within the campus community.

As Michael walks beneath a tall pole along the pathway, a spotlight suddenly shines on him and begins to follow him. The light stays centered on him as he walks, moving smoothly to track his movements. This tracking spotlight provides a solution to the impersonal nature of campus pathways by creating a moment of awareness and connection. The spotlight follows him perfectly, making his presence in the public space visible and acknowledged.

Michael finds the experience transforms his usual walk. He becomes aware of himself in the space, notices other students watching him, and becomes conscious of his movements. After trying different ways of moving to see how the spotlight responds, he continues on his way. When he moves out of range, the spotlight transitions to follow another student entering the area. The next day, Michael purposely takes the same route again, curious to experience the interactive installation once more.
