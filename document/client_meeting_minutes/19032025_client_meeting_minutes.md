**Date:** 12/03/2025

**Client:** Sui Jackson

**Attendees:** Qianwen Shen, Muchen Li, Hongyu Li, Leliang Wang, Zijun Zhou

**Minute Taker:** Qianwen Shen

## Agenda:
1. Review of user stories and personas
2. Technical approach discussion
3. Hardware implementation challenges
4. Project next steps

## Discussion Points

1. **User Stories and Personas Review**
  * Team presented completed user stories and personas to the client
  * Client provided feedback on the materials
  * The "Campus Pathway Experience" scenario was well-received

2. **Technical Approach**
  * Discussed potential implementation methods for tracking system
  * Self-trained model may be used for detection and tracking
  * Final decision on model implementation will depend on runtime performance
  * Need to evaluate processing requirements for real-time tracking

3. **Hardware Challenges**
  * Team reported issue with OpenMV hardware
  * Code is not persisting when hardware is disconnected and reconnected
  * Need to establish protocol for code backup and storage

4. **Next Steps**
  * Finalize technical approach based on performance testing
  * Develop solution for code persistence issue
  * Begin implementation of basic tracking functionality

## Action Items
* Research and test self-trained model options
* Develop backup system for OpenMV code
* Create implementation plan for tracking system
* Prepare progress update for next meeting
